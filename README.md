# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Repository**.

This project was created as part of my journey to learn and practice **JavaScript**, a widely-used and powerful programming language. It includes examples and explanations of various fundamental concepts essential for building a strong foundation in programming.

## What You'll Find

This repository contains beginner-friendly examples covering:

### Basic Syntax
- `console.log()` statements  
- Comments (`//` and `/* */`)

### Variables and Data Types
- Strings, Numbers, Booleans, `null`, `undefined`  
- `let`, `const`, and `var`  
- Type conversion (`String()`, `Number()`, etc.)

### User Input
- Using `prompt()` to receive input from users (in browsers)

### Operators
- Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment

### Control Flow
- `if`, `else if`, `else` statements  
- `while` and `for` loops  
- `switch` statements

### Functions

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

- Practice writing correct and efficient JavaScript code  
- Develop a solid understanding of core programming concepts  
- Build a foundation for learning advanced topics such as asynchronous programming, object-oriented programming, and web development  
- Document and track progress throughout the learning process

## Work in Progress

This repository is a **work in progress**. It will continue to grow as I explore new concepts and best practices in JavaScript programming.

## How to Use

You are welcome to:

- Explore the JavaScript files (`.js`) included in this repository  
- Run them in a browser console, Node.js, or code editor/IDE  
- Modify the code examples to test different behaviors and deepen your understanding of JavaScript
